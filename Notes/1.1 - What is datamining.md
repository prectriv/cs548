# What is data mining?

A way to often reveal 'hidden' data

- implicit, unknown patterns in the dataset
- Used mainly when there is:
  - high dimensionality (columns)
  - Enormity of data
  - heterogenous, distributed nature of data

## Methods

Predictive Methods

- Use variables to predict unknown of future values of other values.
  - Classification  
  - Regression
  - Deviation Detection

Descriptive methods

- Find human-interpretable patterns that describe the data.
  - Clustering
  - Association rule discovery
  - Sequential pattern discovery
