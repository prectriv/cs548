# Similarity and Distance

## Similarity and Dissimilarity

- Similarity
  - Numerical measure of how alike two data objects are.
  - Is higher when objects are more alike.
  - Often falls in the range [0,1]
- Dissimilarity
  - Numerical measure of how different are two data objects
  - Lower when objects are more alike
  - Minimum dissimilarity is often 0
  - Upper limit varies
- Proximity refers to a similarity or dissimilarity

## Distance

- Euclidean Distance
  - ![formula](img/eudlform.png)
  - Where n is the number of dimensions (attributes) and pk and qk are, respectively, the kth attributes (components) or data objects p and q.
  - Standardization is necessary, if scales differ
- Minkowski Distance
  - ![formula](img/minkform.png)
  - Where r is a parameter, n is the number of dimensions (attributes) and pk and qk are, respectively, the kth attributes (components) or data objects p and q
- Mahalanobis Distance
