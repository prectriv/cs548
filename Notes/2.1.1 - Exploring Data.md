# Exploring Data

A preliminary exploration of the data to better understand its characteristics

- Key motivations of data exploration:
  - Helping to select the right tool for preprocessing or analysis
  - making use of humans' ability to recognize patterns - our brains might be able to recognize patterns not captured by analysis
- Related to the area of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Focus on visualization
  - clustering and anomaly detection are viewed as exploratory techniques
  - in ata mining, clustering and anomaly detection are major area of interest, not thought of as just exploratory

## Summary Statistics

- Summarized properties include frequency, location and spread
  - Ex: location is mean, spread is stdv
- most summary statistics can be calculated in a single pass through data
- **Frequency**:
  - The frequency of an attribute value is the percentage of time the value occurs in the data set
  - The mode of an attribute is the most frequent attribute value
  - The notions of frequency and mode are typically used with categorical data.
- **Percentiles**:
  - For continuous data, the notion of a percentile is mroe useful
  - Given an ordinal or continuous attribute x and a number *p* between 0 adn 100, the *p*th percentile is a value x*p* such that *p*% of the observed values of x are less than x*p*.
- **Mean and Median**:
  - Most common measure of the location of a set of points
  - Mean is ver sensitive to outliers, so median or a trimmed mean is also commonly used
- **Range and Variance**:
  - Range is deference between the max and min
  - The variance or stdv is the most common measure of the spread of a set of points
  - However this is also sensitive to outliers, so there alternatives
    - Absolute average deviation
    - Median absolute deviation
    - Interquartile range
