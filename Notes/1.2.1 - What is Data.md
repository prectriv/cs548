# What is data?

Collection of objects and their attributes

- An **attribute** is a property or characteristic of an object (eye color of a person, temperature, etc.)

  - Attribute is also known as variable, field, characteristic, or feature
  - Attribute values are numbers of symbols assigned to an attribute
  - Distinction between attributes and attribute values
    - Same attribute can be mapped (described) using different attribute values
      - Height in feet/meters, temperature in C/F
    - Different attributes can be mapped to the same set of values
      - **Ex**: Attribute values for ID and age are integers, but each value has a different requirements
        - ID has no limits, but age has a min and max value.

- A collection of *attributes* describe an **object**
  - **Ex**: All the characteristics of a person, a whole weather forecast.
  - Object is also known as record, point, case, sample, entity, or instance

## Properties of Attribute Values

- Distinction
  - Equivalency or lack there of
  - Expressed as =, =/=, !=\
- Order
  - Establish order and relative difference (no direct values)
  - Expressed as <, >
- Addition
  - Expressed as +, -
- Multiplication
  - Expressed as *, /

## Types of Attributes

- Nominal
  - Very basic, categorical data
  - No quantitative component whatsoever
  - **Ex**: ID Numbers, color, zip codes
  - **Properties**: distinctness
  - **Operations**: mode, entropy, contingency, corelation, x^2 test
- Ordinal
  - Some sort of ordering possible - relative magnitude
  - Cannot directly capture the difference between two entries
  - **Ex**: rankings such as height, grades, a scale
    - {good, better, best} - no direct difference given
  - **Properties**: distinctness, order
  - **Operations**: median, percentiles, rank correlation, run tests, sigh tests
- Interval
  - Can capture difference
  - **Ex**: Calendar dates, temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
  - **Properties**: distinctness, order, addition
  - **Operations**: mean, stdv, correlation, *t* and *F* tests
- Ratio
  - Quantitative and the difference means something valuable
  - Take ratios of the data
  - **Ex**: Temperature in Kelvin, length, time, counts
  - **Properties**: distinctness, order, addition, multiplication
  - **Operations**: geometric mean, harmonic mean, percent variation

## Discrete vs Continuous Attributes

- Discrete
  - Has only a finite or countably infinite set of values
  - **Ex**: zip codes, counts, or the set of words in a collection of documents
  - Often shown as integer variables
  - Binary attributes are a special case of discrete attributes
- Continuous
  - Has real numbers as attribute values
  - **Ex**: temperature, height, weight
    - (can be measured down to the infinitely small decimal place)
  - Often represented as a floating-point variable
