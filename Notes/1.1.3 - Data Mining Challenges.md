# Challenges of Data Mining

- Scalability
  - Volumes of data are too huge
  - Databases being too expensive to operate
- Dimensionality
  - Number of fields being too large
  - Principle Component Analysis:
    - Need to reduce number of fields we are working with
    - Remove variables that compound on each other
- Complex and Heterogeneous Data
  - Data coming from multiple sources, non-normalized
  - Data must be normalized to accurately affect outcome
- Data Quality
  - Scrub data for malformed/incorrectly formatted/trash data
- Data Ownership and distribution
  - Difficult to determine access based on the many different types of data sources
- Privacy preservation
  - i.e Facebook
- Streaming data
  - Data that is coming in large volumes/real-time
  - Need some way to collect all of it regardless of complexity as it may be useful in the future.
